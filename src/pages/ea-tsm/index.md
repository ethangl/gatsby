### Company Mission

EAs goal is to deliver world class customer/player experience through products, services, as well as support so EA players can consistently receive and engage positively with the games they love.

### Description.

EA WWCE champions the utmost of player experience. When a player has any issue, it is the main mission of WWCE advisors to solve efficiently, and with quality. The current tool and processes within WWCE are vulnerable to tribal knowledge, inconsistent standards, and low performant software.

### Why.

EA WWCE primary CRM system (Omega) was created 5 years ago, on old technology, customized frontend UI (break more stuff to update anything) and delivers a poor and slow quality of support to the advisors handling cases created by every EA player.
